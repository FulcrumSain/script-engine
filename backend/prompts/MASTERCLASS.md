# Short-Form Script Writing — Reference Knowledge

This document contains the theoretical framework behind the script writing system. It is the "why" behind the instructions. Use it to make better decisions when edge cases arise — unusual transcript structures, content that doesn't fit a standard hook type, or scripts that need deeper understanding of the psychology to get right.

## The Hook — Deep Theory

### What a Hook Actually Does

A hook has one job: help the viewer decide to stay.

To do that it must deliver two things simultaneously:

**Topic clarity** — the viewer knows within two seconds what this video is about. Not vaguely. Specifically. They can decide whether this is for them before the algorithm decides for them.

**On-target curiosity** — the viewer believes the video is for them and that what's coming will resolve something they actually have. Not manufactured intrigue. Genuine relevance.

Most creators only work on curiosity. They make hooks mysterious, suspenseful, or surprising. But if the viewer doesn't know what the video is about, they cannot decide to be curious about it. They leave.

Topic clarity comes first. Curiosity second. This order is non-negotiable.

---

### The Four Reasons Hooks Fail

**1. Delay**
The topic is buried after a warm-up, a question, a personal introduction, or context the viewer didn't ask for. Every second without topic clarity, a percentage of viewers make their decision and leave.

Fix: Move the topic to line one. Cut everything that came before it. If removing the first line doesn't break the script, the first line was wrong.

**2. Confusion**
The topic arrives but the sentence structure is tangled. The viewer half-understands and decides not to work for it.

Fix: Sixth-grade reading level. Active voice. One idea per sentence. If you have to read a sentence twice to get it, it fails.

**3. Irrelevance**
The viewer knows what the video is about but doesn't believe it's for them. Usually caused by framing the hook around the creator ("I did this...") instead of the viewer ("If you've ever...").

Fix: Replace every "I" with "you." Frame around a pain point the viewer already carries. The hook should feel like it was written specifically for the person watching.

**4. Disinterest**
Topic clarity is there. Relevance is there. But the hook doesn't create enough pull to make staying feel necessary.

Fix: Introduce contrast. Show the gap between what the viewer currently believes and what you're about to change. Contrast is the engine of curiosity. The gap between A (current state) and B (alternative state) is what creates tension. Tension is what keeps people watching.

Contrast can be stated (name both A and B) or implied (state only B — the viewer infers A from their own experience).

### The Three-Step Hook Formula (Callaway)

1. **Context lean-in** — topic and reason to care, delivered in 1–2 seconds
2. **Scroll-stop interjection** — a contrast word (but / however / yet) that signals something unexpected is coming
3. **Contrarian snapback** — the opposite of what the viewer expected, creating the curiosity gap

Example:
> "Vegas Sphere tech is insane — biggest screen ever, 20x IMAX. *But* get this — the screen is the least impressive part. Because the audio is what will actually blow your mind."

The context lean-in establishes what we're talking about. The contrast word signals a gear shift. The snapback opens the loop.

---

### Visual Hooks

A visual hook has three components working together:

1. **Text on screen** — 3 to 5 bold words that function as a hook even with sound off. The viewer reads this before they hear anything.
2. **Compelling visual** — the right amount of motion. Too much distracts. Too little is boring. The visual should add context, not compete with the text.
3. **Spoken word** — reinforces the visual and text, but does not repeat them word for word.

All three must work together. But the text on screen is the most important — it is what the sound-off viewer sees, and sound-off viewing is the default on most platforms.

## The Script Body — Deep Theory

### Open Loops and Curiosity Chains

Information gaps drive attention. When a viewer doesn't know how something ends, they stay to find out. The body of a script should operate as a chain of open loops — each answer seeds the next question.

The technique: answer the loop you opened in the hook, but seed a new question with your answer before closing it. The viewer is always slightly ahead of where they are, wanting to know what comes next.

### But/Therefore (Not And Then)

This comes from the South Park creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker. They argue that good story structure connects beats with "but" (introduces conflict) or "therefore" (introduces consequence). "And then" is just addition — it has no energy.

Test any two consecutive ideas in your script: if you can connect them with "and then," one of them needs to go or be rewritten. If they connect with "but" or "therefore," the structure is working.

### Reverse Reveal Structure

State the problem or opportunity *before* naming the point. Give the viewer the pain before the painkiller. This creates micro-curiosity within each body point.

- ❌ "The first thing to know is distribution. Distribution is important because most businesses don't have enough of it."
- ✅ "Most service businesses are turning away work not because they lack clients but because they lack people. That's a distribution problem — and it's the first thing you have to solve."

The reverse reveal makes the point land harder because the viewer already feels the problem before they receive the solution.

### Sentence Rhythm (Gary Provost)

Vary sentence length. Short sentences create punch. They add emphasis. They force clarity. But a script that only has short sentences starts to feel staccato and exhausting. A longer sentence, one with more breath and more weight to it, creates contrast — and contrast is what keeps the ear engaged. Then back to short. Make it work.

Write each line on its own row. Look at the right edge. If it is even — all the same length — rewrite. You want a jagged right edge. That is rhythm.

### Conversational Tone

Write for one specific person, not a demographic. Not "service business owners." One specific person with one specific problem watching this on their phone in a specific moment. When you know who that person is, the script becomes a direct message instead of a broadcast.

## The Five Hook Types — When to Use Each

**Hot Take Hook**
Best for: challenging a widely held belief your audience has
Strength: high initial attention, strong comment triggers
Weakness: can feel aggressive if the contrarian claim isn't genuinely defensible
Use when: the transcript contains a clear counterintuitive insight

**Data/Insight Hook**
Best for: audiences who respond to evidence and logic
Strength: high algorithmic performance (falsifiable claims get shared and cited)
Weakness: needs a genuinely interesting number — a boring stat is worse than no stat
Use when: the transcript contains a specific, surprising, falsifiable data point

**Story Hook (Messenger Frame)**
Best for: emotional connection and relatability
Strength: most natural fit for the Messenger Voice
Weakness: story must be specific and concrete — a vague story is no story
Use when: the transcript's core insight lands better through a character or situation than through a claim

**Question Hook**
Best for: driving comments and self-identification
Strength: highest comment rate of the five types; creates immediate personal relevance
Weakness: the question must feel genuinely personal — rhetorical questions create no tension
Use when: the viewer's own experience is the best way in to the insight

**Preview Hook**
Best for: high-trust audiences; content where the payoff is genuinely strong
Strength: highest completion rate when the payoff delivers on the promise
Weakness: if the payoff doesn't match the preview, retention crashes midway
Use when: the content has four or more distinct actionable points, or when the core insight is strong enough to state upfront without losing interest

## Hormozi's Value Equation in Content

People decide to stay in a video (and decide to act after it) based on an implicit value calculation:

**Value = (Dream Outcome × Perceived Likelihood of Success) ÷ (Time Delay × Effort Required)**

In script terms:
- **Dream outcome** — be specific and visual. Not "grow your business" — "book 10 new clients in 90 days without running a single ad."
- **Perceived likelihood** — social proof that is falsifiable. Real numbers. Real client results. Real timeframes.
- **Time delay** — name how quickly the viewer can expect a result. The shorter, the better.
- **Effort required** — name what they *don't* have to do. Remove friction from the implied cost of acting.

Stack the numerator. Minimise the denominator. Every hook and close should do at least one of these four things.

---

## Story Intro Formats (Hormozi)

When the script needs a story to open the body, use one of these three:

**Mini history lesson** — explain how the current situation came to exist. Sets up a "therefore it makes sense that..." frame that makes the insight feel inevitable rather than imposed.

**Metaphor or analogy** — connect the insight to something the viewer already understands. The best analogies make the new thing feel familiar and the familiar thing feel new.

**Personal story or client case study** — specific before/after with numbers. The specificity is the credibility. "A client of mine" with no detail is not a story. "A plumbing business doing $800K a year that hadn't changed their pricing in four years" is a story.

## The Messenger Voice — Extended Logic

The Messenger Voice is not humility for its own sake. It is a strategic positioning decision grounded in how trust actually forms.

People trust word-of-mouth more than expertise claims. A friend saying "I read this and it changed how I think about X" outperforms an authority saying "I am an expert in X and here is what you should do." The friend is credible because they have no obvious incentive to oversell. The expert is suspect because they do.

The Messenger Voice positions the creator as the friend — the one who reads everything, filters the noise, and brings back the things that matter. Over time, the act of consistently bringing valuable ideas *is* the expertise. The curation becomes the authority.

This is not a workaround for a creator who hasn't built credibility yet. It is the correct long-term strategy for a creator who wants their credibility to compound naturally from their track record of taste rather than from self-declaration.

The three tests for whether a Messenger Voice script is working:

1. **The source is specific** — even if anonymised, "a CEO I know" or "a creator who's done a billion views" or "a book called [title]" is more credible than "someone said"
2. **The creator's opinion is present** — after the insight is delivered, the creator adds their own "here's what this means for us" layer. The source delivers the insight. The creator delivers the application. Without the creator's voice, it's just a summary.
3. **The framing is unique** — the same idea could be shared by a hundred people, but this person's angle, their choice of what to emphasise, their specific example — that's what makes it theirs.

## Why Service Businesses Specifically

Service business owners have a natural advantage in short-form content that most don't use:

- Real clients with real before-and-after results
- Specific numbers, timeframes, and dollar amounts they can reference
- Proprietary observations from inside many businesses in their niche
- The authority that comes from actually doing the work, not just talking about it

The failure mode for most service business content is staying generic. "Tips for running a better business" — no specificity, no proof, no reason to trust this person over anyone else.

The content that actually books calendars is the content that makes one specific viewer feel like the creator has been inside their business, understands their exact situation, and has already solved it for someone exactly like them.

Zoom in. Always zoom in. The specific is always more powerful than the general. The concrete is always more memorable than the abstract. The falsifiable is always more credible than the vague.

## Quick Reference Tables

### The Four Hook Mistakes

| Mistake | Symptom | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Delay | Topic arrives after line 2 | Move topic to line 1, cut everything before it |
| Confusion | Viewer can't self-select in | Simplify, active voice, one idea per sentence |
| Irrelevance | Viewer knows the topic but doesn't feel it's for them | Use "you/your," frame around a real pain point |
| Disinterest | Hook is clear but doesn't pull | Add contrast — A vs B, or imply A by stating B alone |

### Harry Dry's Three Rules

| Rule | Test | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Visualise it | Close your eyes. Can you see it? | Zoom in. Keep asking "what do I mean?" until concrete |
| Falsify it | Is this true or false? | Replace adjectives with specific facts and numbers |
| Own it | Could a competitor sign this? | Find what only this creator can say |

### The Five Variation Types

| Type | Opens With | Best For | Risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| Hot Take | Contrarian claim | High attention, comments | Must be genuinely defensible |
| Data/Insight | Specific number or finding | Algorithmic reach, sharing | Needs a genuinely interesting stat |
| Story/Messenger | One concrete moment or conversation | Emotional connection, Messenger Voice | Story must be specific — no vague stories |
| Question | Personal, relevant question | Comments, self-identification | Question must feel personal not rhetorical |
| Preview | Promise of specific payoff | Completion rate, high-trust audiences | Payoff must deliver on promise |
